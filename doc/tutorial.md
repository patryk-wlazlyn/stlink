| --flash=n[k, M]       | st-flash                           | One can specify `--flash=128k` for example, to override the default value of 64k for the STM32F103C8T6 to assume 128k of flash being present. This option accepts decimal (128k), octal 0200k, or hex 0x80k values.<br />Leaving the multiplier out is equally valid, e.g.: `--flash=0x20000`. The size may be followed by an optional "k" or "M" to multiply the given value by 1k (1024) or 1M (1024 x 1024) respectively.<br />One can read arbitary addresses of memory out to a binary file with: `st-flash read out.bin 0x8000000 4096`. In this example `4096 bytes` are read and subsequently written to `out.bin`.<br />Binary files (here: `in.bin`) are written into flash memory with: `st-flash write in.bin 0x8000000` | v1.4.0               |
| --format              | st-flash                           | Specify file image format to read or write.<br />Valid formats are `binary` and `ihex`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | v1.3.0               |
| --freq=n[k, M]        | st-info<br />st-flash<br />st-util | The frequency of the SWD/JTAG interface can be specified, to override the default 1800 kHz configuration.<br />This option solely accepts decimal values representing kHz. The prefix "k" may be added for better understanding, but has no effect. In addition, values can be interpreted as thousands of kHz thus representing MHz. This is achieved by using the prefix "M".<br />Valid frequencies are: `5k, 15k, 25k, 50k, 100k, 125k, 240k, 480k, 950k, 1200k (1.2M), 1800k (1.8M), 4000k (4M)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | v1.6.1               |
| --opt                 | st-flash                           | Optimisation can be enabled in order to skip flashing empty (0x00 or 0xff) bytes at the end of binary file.<br />This may cause some garbage data left after a flash operation. This option was enabled by default in earlier releases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | v1.6.1               |
| --reset               | st-flash                           | Trigger a reset after flashing. The default uses the hardware reset through `NRST` pin.<br />A software reset (via `AIRCR`; since v1.5.1) is used, if the hardware reset failed (`NRST` pin not connected).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | v1.0.0               |
| --connect-under-reset | st-info<br />st-flash<br />st-util | Connect under reset. Option makes it possible to connect to the device before code execution. This is useful when the target contains code that lets the device go to sleep, disables debug pins or other special code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | v1.6.1               |

### Reading & Writing Option Bytes

Example to read and write option bytes:

```
./st-flash --debug read option_bytes_dump.bin 0x1FFF7800 4
./st-flash --debug write option_bytes_dump.bin 0x1FFF7800
```

### st-flash: Checksum for binary files

When flashing a file, a checksum is calculated for the binary file, both in md5 and the sum algorithm.
The latter is also used by the official ST-LINK utility tool from STMicroelectronics as described in the document: [`UM0892 - User manual STM32 ST-LINK utility software description`](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/cd00262073-stm32-stlink-utility-software-description-stmicroelectronics.pdf).

### stlink-gui

The `stlink` toolset also provides a GUI which is an optional feature. It is only installed if a gtk3 toolset has been detected during package installation or compilation from source. It is not available for Windows. If you prefer to have an user interface on the latter system, please use the official `ST-LINK Utility` instead.

The stlink-gui offers the following features:

- Connect/disconnect to a present STlink programmer
- Display basic device information
- Select a binary file from the local filesystem to flash it to the detected device connected to the programmer
- Export the memory of the connected chip to a file which can be saved to the local filesystem
- Display of the memory address map in the main window for each, the device memory and a loaded binary file

Within the GUI main window tooltips explain the available user elements.

## HowTos & solutions to common problems

### a) Verify if udev rules are set correctly (by Dave Hylands)

To investigate, start by plugging your STLINK device into the usb port. Then run `lsusb`. You should see an entry something like the following:

```
Bus 005 Device 017: ID 0483:374b STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1 (Nucleo-F103RB)
```

Note the bus number (005) and the Device (017). You should then do:
`ls -l /dev/bus/usb/005/017` (replacing 005 and 017 appropriately).

On my system I see the following:

```
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 189, 528 Jan 24 17:52 /dev/bus/usb/005/017
```

which is world writable (this is from the `MODE:="0666"` below). I have several files in my `/lib/udev/rules.d` directory. In this particular case, the `49-stlinkv2-1.rules` file contains the following:

```
# STM32 nucleo boards, with onboard STLINK/V2-1
# ie, STM32F0, STM32F4.
# STM32VL has STLINK/V1, which is quite different

SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="374b", \
    MODE:="0666", \
    SYMLINK+="stlinkv2-1_%n"

# If you share your linux system with other users, or just don't like the
# idea of write permission for everybody, you can replace MODE:="0666" with
# OWNER:="yourusername" to create the device owned by you, or with
# GROUP:="somegroupname" and mange access using standard unix groups.
```

and the `idVendor` of `0483` and `idProduct` of `374b` matches the vendor id from the `lsusb` output.

Make sure that you have all 3 files from [/config/udev/rules.d](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink/tree/master/config/udev/rules.d) in your `/lib/udev/rules.d` directory. After copying new files or editing existing files in `/lib/udev/rules.d` you should run the following:

```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

to ensure that the rules actually take effect. Using the trigger command means that you shouldn't need to unplug and replug the device, but you might want to try that for good measure as well.

If the VID:PID of your device doesn't match those in any of the 3 files, then you may need to create a custom rule file to match your VID:PID.

### b) NOTE: Chinese Fake-Chips CKS32F103C8T6 or CS32F103C8T6 being marked as "STM32F103C8T6"

In contrast to "Clone chips" which identify themselves as such by their official marking (manufacturer, model, etc.), so called "Fake chips" do not.
Instead counterfeiters try to copy the outer appearance of the original and thus are very hard to detect.
Possible malfunction then may lead to various effects and issues during operation also in in connection with this toolset.

As of December 2019 several so called "Bluepill-Boards" with a STM32F103C8T6 appeared on the market that do not hold the original part.
In this known example one finds the counterfeited "STM32F103C8T6" MCUs to identify themselves with chip-id `0x2ba01477` instead of `0x1ba01477`.

In the following you find some hints on how to identify your chip and track down fraud:

- [How to Detect STM32 Fakes](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/03/22/how-to-detect-stm32-fakes/)
- [Confirmation by STMicroelectronics](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/442839/couterfeit_STM.PNG) (Marking: 991KA 93 MYS 807)
- [STM32 Clones: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly](https://hackaday.com/2020/10/22/stm32-clones-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/)

However it appears that not all counterfeited parts cause problems during operation, but some are known to not even being able to execute a basic "blinky" example binary. Further there can be problems that may not even show up or affect you directly, but somewhen later in time (or maybe never).
This demonstrates there is no guarantee for a proper working chip with equal functionality compared to the original.

Please keep this in mind and be sceptical when facing problems with this type of boards.
Check your hardware and try to identify what you have in front of you before assuming a bug in the `stlink` toolset.

Please let us know, if you come across any further websites or tutorials that help to identify STM32 fake chips so we can list them here to help others.

### c) Appearance of the warning message `WARN src/common_legacy.c: unknown chip id!`

The chip ID is the main identifier for STM32 MCU and their specific type and provides primary information on flash and SRAM architecture.
This so called `DBGMCU_IDCODE` register is allocated either at memory address `0xE0042000` or `0x40015800`.

A failure of chip identification results in the error `WARN src/common_legacy.c: unknown chip id!`.
There are different variants of this message that refer to different issues:

- `unknown chip id! 0` --> Target chip (board) is unknown.
  1. Microcontroller is in stop/standby mode.
  2. The signals `DIO` and `CLK` are reversed on the SWD-Interface.
- `unknown chip id! 0x3748` --> A target chip (board) cannot be detected.
  1. No target is connected --> In this case `st-info --probe` displays `chip id 0x0748` with STLINK/V2 and `chip id 0x03e8` with STLINK-V3.
  2. The chip is connected but has gone into an undefined state of operation where the SWD pins are unresponsive. --> Try to use `--connect-under-reset` while pressing the reset button on the target board.
  3. A firmware-issue prevents the programmer from normal operation. --> Ensure that your programmer runs the latest firmware version and consider to upgrade any older version by using the official firmware upgrade tool provided by STMicroelectronics.
- `unknown chip id! 0xe0042000` --> The memory register holding the information on the chip ID could not be read. The following problems may lead to this case:
  1. This problem is caused by the SWDIO and SWCLK being configured for other purpose (GPIO, etc) other than Serial Wire configuration or Jtag --> A possible solution to this is to short the `BOOT0` pin with `VDD` (1) and to reset the chip / board by the execuing `st-flash erase` in order to return the MCU back to normal operation. Afterwards `BOOT0` should be set back to `GND` (0).
  2. There is a hardware defect in the connection between the MCU and the used programmer (solder points, cables, connectors).

### d) Understanding hardware and software reset functionality for `st-flash` and reset-related device recovery

Typically a reset signal is sent via the reset pin `NRST`. Using `st-flash` for flashing results in the following behaviour:

- without the `--reset` option: `st-flash write` results in one reset signal on the `NRST` line
- with the `--reset` option: `st-flash write --reset` results in two subsequent reset signals on the `NRST` line

Depending on the used programmer the hardware reset line is not always connected.
This is especially the case for low-cost STLINK/V2 clone programmers.
Here the SWD connector consists of only 4 pins: `VCC`, `SWCLK`, `GND` and `SWDATA`.

When the physical reset line `NRST` is not connected, a reset is initiated by software via `SWD_SWDIO/JTAG_TMS` (software reset).
Just as mentioned above, flashing is possible here eiher with and without the `--reset` option.

Configuring the STM32 pin `JTAG_TMS/SWD_SWDIO` as an output now also prevents the SWD interface from flashing and resetting the device.
In consequence this constellation typically requires a _hard reset_ to allow for the ST-Link/V2 programmer to reconnect to the target at all.

As soon as the device is in DFU mode, the `JTAG_TMS/SWD_SWDIO` pin is left in the default state with all JTAG pins available.
Here flashing of the device is now possible with and without the `--reset` option.

The debug command `(gdb) monitor jtag_reset` sends a _hard reset_ signal via the `NRST` pin to reset the device and allows for flashing it (again).

### e) Note on setting hardware breakpoints for external bus (Example: STM32H735-DK)

GDB is setting breakpoints based on the XML memory map designation of `rom` or `ram`, which is hardcoded in st-util for a given processor.
However the external bus can be *RAM* or *ROM* depending on design.

The STM32H735-DK has external FLASH at address 0x90000000. As a result, because the entire external memory range is `ram` as it could be either,
software breakpoints (Z0) get sent when a breakpoint is created and they never get tripped as the memory area is read only.

### f) UART-Access via a virtual COM port

Access to the Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) via a virtual COM port is not related to the stlink toolset itself. It is an independent feature that should natively be available on UNIX-based operating systems. Windows operating systems require the installation of a virtual COM device driver. The appropriate device driver is downloaded and installed automatically via Windows Update in the background as soon as the device is plugged-in for the first time. A connected ST-LINK programmer with UART functionality is detected as a CDC (ACM) USB device. After each reset the device will be reloaded and will pop up as `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyACM1` depending on the specific design.

UART connections to the interface are typically initiated with a serial terminal. For UNIX operating systems we recommend to use either [minicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom) (terminal-based) or [cutecom](https://cutecom.sourceforge.net/) (GUI-based). Windows users should have a look at [Teraterm](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm). 

Most common and established settings for the interface are 115200 or 9600 baud together with the `8-N-1` configuration, standing for (8) data bits, no parity bit (N) and (1) stop bit. Please refer to relevant literature on the UART interface for more detailed technical information and limitations.

Note: On some debian-based UNIX-based systems the `modemmanager` package is installed by default. In has been reported that this tool unfortunately may delay the release of the serial port to applications which is handled by the operating system in the background. Subseqently the CDC/ACM device is also delayed after each reset. This typically includes not only the connection itself, but also some programming operations (at least those using the mass storage emulation). However one can not predict the behaviour exactly - in some cases the boards may be essentially useless or even working fairly well.
Proper determined functionality can be achieved by uninstalling the `modemmanager` package or by setting an appropriate `udev` device rule.

## Using the GDB server

This assumes you have got the [libopencm3](http://www.libopencm3.org) project downloaded in `ocm3`.
The libopencm3 project provides a firmware library, with solid examples for Cortex M3, M4 and M0 processors
from any vendor. It has some good, reliable examples for each of the Discovery boards.

Even if you don’t plan on using libopencm3, the examples they provide
will help you verify that:

- Your installed toolchain is capable of compiling for cortex M3/M4
  targets
- stlink is functional
- Your arm-none-eabi-gdb is functional
- Your board is functional

A GDB server must be started to interact with the STM32 by running
st-util tool :

```
$> st-util

# Full help for other options (listen port, version)
$> st-util --help
```

Then, GDB can be used to interact with the kit:

```
$> $TOOLCHAIN_PATH/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb example_file.elf
```

From GDB, connect to the server using:

```
(gdb) target extended localhost:4242
```

GDB has memory maps for as many chips as it knows about, and will load
your project into either flash or SRAM based on how the project was
linked. Linking projects to boot from SRAM is beyond the scope of this
document.

Because of these built in memory maps, after specifying the .elf at the
command line, now we can simply “load” the target:

```
(gdb) load
```

st-util will load all sections into their appropriate addresses, and
“correctly” set the PC register. So, to run your freshly loaded program,
simply “continue”

```
(gdb) continue
```

Your program should now be running, and, if you used one of the blinking
examples from libopencm3, the LEDs on the board should be blinking for
you.

## Using the gdb server

To run the gdb server:

```
$ make && [sudo] ./st-util

There are a few options:

./st-util - usage:

  -h, --help                     Print this help
  -vXX, --verbose=XX             Specify a specific verbosity level (0..99)
  -v, --verbose                  Specify general verbose logging
  -p 4242, --listen_port=1234    Set the listen port for the gdb server (default: 4242)-
  -m, --multi                    Set gdb server to extended mode. st-util will continue listening for connections after disconnect.
  -n, --no-reset, --hot-plug     Do not reset board on connection.
```

The STLink device to use can be specified using the --serial parameter.

Then, in your project directory, someting like this...
(remember, you need to run an _ARM_ gdb, not an x86 gdb)

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb fancyblink.elf
...
(gdb) tar extended-remote :4242
...
(gdb) load
Loading section .text, size 0x458 lma 0x8000000
Loading section .data, size 0x8 lma 0x8000458
Start address 0x80001c1, load size 1120
Transfer rate: 1 KB/sec, 560 bytes/write.
(gdb)
...
(gdb) continue
```

## Resetting the chip from GDB

You may reset the chip using GDB if you want. You'll need to use `target
extended-remote' command like in this session:

```
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:4242
Remote debugging using localhost:4242
0x080007a8 in _startup ()
(gdb) kill
Kill the program being debugged? (y or n) y
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/whitequark/ST/apps/bally/firmware.elf
```

Note that st-link does not support 'run', as it does not load arbitrary programs without explicit commands.
In order to continue, one can use 'monitor reset' to reset the MCU.

Remember that you can shorten the commands. `tar ext :4242` is good enough
for GDB.

If you need to send a reset signal, you can use the following command:

```
(gdb) monitor jtag_reset
```

## Disassembling THUMB code in GDB

By default, the disassemble command in GDB operates in ARM mode. The programs running on CORTEX-M3 are compiled in THUMB mode.
To correctly disassemble them under GDB, uses an odd address. For instance, if you want to disassemble the code at 0x20000000, use:

```
(gdb) disassemble 0x20000001
```

## Running programs from SRAM

You can run your firmware directly from SRAM if you want to. Just link
it at 0x20000000 and do

```
(gdb) load firmware.elf
```

It will be loaded, and pc will be adjusted to point to start of the
code, if it is linked correctly (i.e. ELF has correct entry point).

## Writing to flash

The GDB stub ships with a correct memory map, including the flash area.
If you would link your executable to `0x08000000` and then do

```
(gdb) load firmware.elf
```

then it would be written to the memory.
